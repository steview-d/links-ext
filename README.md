### A Chrome browser extension for my Code Institute Milestone 4 project, Links.

My MS4 project is a web based bookmark manager, called Links.

At it's most basic level, the app will store a users bookmarks for easy reference at a later stage.

To aid users in adding bookmarks to the app, rather than forcing them to continually copy / paste urls from the address bar and add them manually, this extension is designed to make the whole process quicker and easier.

When a user clicks on the extension, it will open a new tab which points to the links app, and also sends the current URL to an 'add url' view.

From there the app will take care of the rest, the extension simply copies the current page address, and throws it at the Links app.
